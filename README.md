# Face Finder 2000 #

Simple project to find a face. Born from my HackED 2019 project, which was a bit of
a flop. I did a lot of OpenCV stuff and I wanted to have a concrete project from this.

The eventual idea is to throw this on my website.

I want to have it input a bunch of training files and then spit out an image with your face found.
